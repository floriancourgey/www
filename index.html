    <span class="d-inline-block lead pb-5">Professional solutions designer since 2014</span><br>
    For the past few years, I’ve been working on many projects to help companies improve their online business<br>
    <br>
    After a master in Management of Information Services at EPF in 2017, I’m now working for LVMH in both New York and Paris.<br>
    <br>
    I retired from my past freelance activity (2014-2018) where I’ve been involved in large scale projects with renowned companies such as Dassault and Bouygues, as well as new players such as All Fit Company and SILA<br>
